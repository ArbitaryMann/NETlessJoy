NetlessPad is an iOS application that allows you to control your computer from your iOS device with just its Deamon.

## Features
- Communication via the deamon installed to your PC/Mac
- Realtime Control
- Auto Updating Daemon
- Cellular support after NAT Port-Forwarding

## Requirements
- AltStore (sideloading ipa file)
- Mac/Windows Computer

## Licensing

Due to the licensing of some dependencies used by AltStore, I have no choice but to distribute AltStore under the **AGPLv3 license**. That being said, my goal for AltStore is for it to be an open source project *anyone* can use without restrictions, so I explicitly give permission for anyone to use, modify, and distribute all *my* original code for this project in any form, with or without attribution, without fear of legal consequences (dependencies remain under their original licenses, however).
